// This config file makes your client send a ton of rcon commands to whatever server you have rcon access to.
// If that server was running an ETF2L 6v6 config at the time, the classlimits and whitelist will correctly be set up for KnightComp.

// This is particularly useful for serveme.tf servers, as it allows you to play KnightComp despite this format not being built into serveme.tf's functionality.

// To use, "exec KnightComp_ETF2L_Override" in console.
