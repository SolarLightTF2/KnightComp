# How to use?

Every file except "KnightComp_ETF2L_Override.cfg" is intended for server use.

"KnightComp_ETF2L_Override.cfg" is intended to be used on a client's PC, in cases where the server does not support KnightComp but DOES support an ETF2L 6v6 Config. At the moment, this is the file we are using to host pugs on serveme.tf servers.

In these cases, the person who rented the server out execs this on their client and it sends a lot of commands through rcon to set up the server for KnightComp. However, the server MUST have been using an ETF2L 6v6 config beforehand.
